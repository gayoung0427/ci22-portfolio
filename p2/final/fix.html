        There are some punctuations that are interesting 
        and there are some punctuations that are not. Let us 
        begin with the punctuations that are not. Of 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'these,');">these</label>
        the one but the first and the most <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, '');">the</label> 
        completely <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, '');">most</label>
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'uninteresting,');">uninteresting</label> 
        is the question mark. The question 
        mark is alright when it is all <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'alone; when');">alone when</label>
        it is used as a brand on <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'cattle,');">cattle</label> 
        or when it could be used in decoration 
        but connected with <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'writing,');">writing</label> 
        it is <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'completely, entirely, completely');">completely entirely completely</label> 
        uninteresting. It is evident that <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'if');">is</label> you ask a question 
        you ask a <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'question,');">question</label> but anybody who can read at all knows 
        when a question is a question as it is written in writing. 
        Therefore I ask <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'you, therefore, wherefore,');">you therefore wherefore </label>
        should one use the question mark. 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'Beside,');">Beside</label> it does not in its form go 
        with ordinary <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'printing,');">printing</label> 
        and so it pleases neither the eye nor the 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'ear; and');">ear and</label> it is therefore 
        like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. 
        A question is a <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'question; anybody');">question, anybody</label> 
        can know that a question is a <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'question,');">question</label> 
        and so why add to it the question mark when it is 
        already there when the question is already there in the writing. 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'Therefore,');">Therefore </label>
        I never could bring myself to use a question 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'mark.');">mark,</label> 
        I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.
        Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, 
        they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the 
        writing or the <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'printing,');">printing</label> 
        and <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'anyway,');">anyway</label> 
        what is the <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'use');">use,</label> 
        if you do not know that a question is a <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'question;');">question</label> 
        what is the use of its being a question. 
        The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing 
        I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks 
        and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. 
        Perhaps some day they will see it some other 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'way,');">way</label> but not at 
        any rate anybody can and does see it that way.
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="bodytext">
        So there are the uninteresting things in 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'punctuation,');">punctuation</label> 
        uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so 
        we do not have to go any 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'further');">farther</label> into that. There are 
        besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting 
        spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that 
        way about them. 
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="bodytext">
        One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'about,');">about</label> 
        and that is the apostrophe for possession. 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'Well,');">Well</label> feel 
        as you like about that, I can 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'see,');">see</label> and I do see that for 
        many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a 
        gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to 
        definitely decide to do without it. One does do without 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'it.');">it,</label> 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'I do.');">I do,</label> 
        I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time 
        to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time 
        I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not 
        like <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'it,');">it</label> 
        and leaving it <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'out,');">out</label> 
        I feel no regret, 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'there. It');">there it</label> is 
        unnecessary and not <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'ornamental,');">ornamental</label> 
        but inside a word and its <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 's, well,');">s well</label> perhaps,
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, '');">perhaps</label>
        it does appeal by its weakness to your 
        weakness. At least at any <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'rate,');">rate</label> 
        from time to time I do find 
        myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it 
        has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from 
        time to time let it come in.

    <br><br><br>
    <p class="bodytext">
        So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, 
        commas, colons, semi-colons and <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'capital,');">capitals</label> 
        and small letters.

        Let us begin with <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'these.');">these</label>

        When I first began writing, I felt that writing should 
        go <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'on.');">on,</label> 
        I still do feel that it should go on but when I 
        first began <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'writing,');">writing</label> 
        I was completely possessed by the 
        necessity that writing should go 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'on,');">on</label> and 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'on,');">on</label> and if writing 
        should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, 
        what had periods to do with it what had small letters 
        and capitals to do with it to do with writing going 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'on,');">on</label> 
        which was at that time the most profound need I had in 
        connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons 
        to do with <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'it? What');">it what</label> 
        had commas to do with 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'it? What');">it what</label> had

        completely I had to have writing go on,

        had always <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'liked');">like</label> 
        the look of periods and I liked what they

        did not really keep one from going 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'on. It');">on, it</label> 
        was nothing that 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'interfered. It');">interfered, it</label> 
        was only something 
        that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural 
        happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. 
        I really never stopped using them.

        I will read you a little of it. 
        By the time I had written this poem about three years 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'ago,');">ago</label> 
        periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. 
        They could begin to act as they thought best and one might 
        interrupt one’s writing with 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'them. That');">them that</label> 
        is not really <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'interrupting');">interrupt</label> 
        one’s writing with 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'them,');">them</label>

        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, '');">stop</label> 
        at times in one’s 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'writing,');">writing</label> 
        and so they could be used and 
        you could use 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'them. Periods');">them Periods</label> 
        could come to exist in this 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'way,');">way</label> and 
        they could come in this way to have a life of their own. 
        They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons 
        and semi-colons do. 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'Yes,');">Yes</label> you do feel what I mean.

        Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a

        You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from

        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'things,');">things</label> 
        that commas would be degrading. Why if you want 
        the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'complication,');">complication</label> 
        would you want any artificial aid to bring about that 
        simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'simplicity?');">simplicity.</label> 
        Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'did,');">did</label> 
        and as I do.

        When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than 
        to cut the knot, at least 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'if');">of</label> 
        anybody feels <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'that');">who</label> 
        is working with 
        any thread, so anybody feels 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'that');">who</label> 
        is working with any 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'tool,');">tool</label> so anybody 
        feels <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'that');">who</label> 
        is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been 
        written. And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make 
        easy a thing <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'that,');">that</label> 
        if you like it <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'enough,');">enough</label> 
        is easy enough without 
        the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, 
        make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the 
        most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'breath,');">breath</label> 
        but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself 
        that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether 
        has something to do with going on, but taking a breath 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'well,');">well</label> you 
        are always taking a 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'breath,');">breath</label> 
        and why emphasize one breath rather 
        than another breath. 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'Anyway,');">Anyway</label> 
        that is the way I felt about it and 
        I felt that about it 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'very,');">very</label> 
        very strongly. And so I almost never 
        used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence 
        the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following 
        one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I
         felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by 
         themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by 
         putting in a comma.

        So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in 
        <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'poetry,');">poetry</label> 
        it is a little <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'different,');">different</label> 
        but more <label class="underline" onclick="change(this, 'so,');">so</label> 
        and later I will go into that. 
        But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.
